# Single-core-EDF-VD-Scheduling
This project has implemented the Early Deadline First with Virtual Deadline (EDF-VD) scheduling algorithm using C++ in a simple manner. This algorithm is suitable for mixed criticality systems. In this implementation, only the critical level upgrade of the system is considered, without involving the downgrade of critical levels.
